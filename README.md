#### General description

`swaRm` is a R package meant to standardize and accelerate the processing of 
data describing the movements of animal and human groups (e.g. fish schools, 
bird flocks). 

`swarm` is a work in progress. Functions are not yet in a stable state and are 
likely to change as the package gets developed. 

---

#### Installation

Until `swaRm` is submitted to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), the easiest 
way to install and keep the package up-to-date is by using its associated 
[`drat`](http://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/DratFAQ.html) repository as follows:

```r
install.packages("drat")  # This line is required if drat is not present 
                          # in your R installation.

drat::addRepo("swarm-lab")
install.packages("swaRm")
```
